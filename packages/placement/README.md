# @n-uf/placement

> [!CAUTION]
> ## Not yet stable
>
> **@n-uf/placement is young and still changing. Its API (the desk constructions, the toolbar model and the drop targets) is not final.**
>
> Version numbers are dates (YY.M.R), not semantic versions, so any release may break things. Pin an exact version and read the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/n-uf/motion/blob/main/packages/placement/CHANGELOG.md) before you upgrade.

Where things go. State in, rects and drop targets out: a desk of docks, rails and palettes, toolbar groups in hosts
and zones, and the drop targets for each. A tiling entry (a split tree with ratios, groups and workspaces) is
planned. Pure functions over plain data: no DOM,
no framework, no motion, no dependencies.

```sh
npm i @n-uf/placement
```

Its sibling [`@n-uf/motion`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@n-uf/motion) owns how things move. The two compose
without importing each other: a target list from `@n-uf/placement/targets` is exactly what
`@n-uf/motion/drag`'s drag intent takes, and a rect from any layout here is what `@n-uf/motion/layout` glides to.

- **`@n-uf/placement`**: the shapes (`Rect`, `Size`, `Point`) and a popup positioner (anchor, gravity, offset,
  then flip, slide, resize, as Wayland's xdg-positioner).
- **`/dock`**: a desk of documents and tool panels. Side docks and a bottom dock (between the side docks or across
  the full width), rails, natural-height sections whose last one takes the rest, fold and unfold, the give-way
  rules (sections fold least recently used first, docks fold to their rails), floating palettes with corner stacks,
  tear-off and dock-back; and nine constructions built from these parts, as presets (`createDesk`).
- **`/toolbar`**: toolbar groups in five hosts (title, top, bottom, left, right) and three zones (start, centre,
  end), floating groups, insertion points (before all, between, after all, an empty zone), trailing-first overflow,
  and "own place is home".
- **`/targets`**: drop targets (`{ id, priority, hit, slot?, label?, free? }`) for the desk's constructions and
  toolbar hosts.

Rendering stays in the app: it draws the rects, measures its groups, and feeds pointer samples to a drag intent.

## A desk

```ts
import { DEFAULT_OPTIONS, createDesk } from "@n-uf/placement/dock";

const desk = createDesk({
  panels: [
    { id: 1, title: "Files", natural: 160 },
    { id: 2, title: "Outline", natural: 200 },
    { id: 3, title: "History", natural: 160 },
  ],
  start: { left: [1, 2], right: [], bottom: [3] },
});
const docks = desk.constructionOf("docks");
const { items, notes } = docks.layout(docks.initial([1, 2]), { width: 960, height: 420 }, DEFAULT_OPTIONS);
console.log(items.get("panel:3")!.look, notes.map((n) => n.code)); // header [ 'bottom-folded' ]
```

Each construction is `{ id, title, idea, initial(docs, size?), layout(state, size, options) }`. A layout returns a
`Placed` per item (its rect, look, layer, and whether it is hidden, has a minimum or may scroll off the stage) and
notes saying how it gave way. A note's `code` (with its `side` and `items` where they apply) is the contract; its
`text` is English for people, and its wording may change in any release. The codes (`NoteCode`):

| Code | Says | Also |
|---|---|---|
| `bottom-folded` | the bottom dock folded to its header | |
| `dock-folded` | a side dock folded to its rail | `side` |
| `sections-folded` | sections folded to their headers by themselves, least recently used first | |
| `torn-floating` | panels torn off a dock float | `items` |
| `torn-shaded` | some torn-off panels shade because they don't fit | |
| `columns-railed` | the tiling tree's side columns folded to rails | `side` when only one |
| `tiles-float` | tiles that broke a minimum float, newest first | `items` |
| `tabs-folded` | a tabbed side folded to icon tabs | `side` |
| `drawer-over` | a drawer slides over the documents | `side` |
| `column-split` | a strip column split in two | `items` |
| `strip-scrolls` | the strip is wider than the stage | |
| `stacks-merged` | both palette stacks share one corner | |
| `palettes-shaded` | palettes shaded to their title bars | |
| `palettes-cover` | how much of the documents the palettes cover | |
| `docs-room` | how much room the palettes leave the documents | |

## Toolbar groups

```ts
import { arrangement, layoutHost } from "@n-uf/placement/toolbar";

const a = arrangement({ top: { start: ["file", "edit"], end: ["share"] } });
const size = (_id: string, _vertical: boolean, collapsed: boolean) => ({ along: collapsed ? 30 : 120, across: 28 });
const top = layoutHost(a.top, "top", { length: 320, thickness: 34, lead: 8, tail: 8 }, size);
console.log(top.overflow); // [ 'share' ]

// A primary group keeps its full form longest: a higher keep folds later (equal keeps fold from the trailing end).
const kept = layoutHost(a.top, "top", { length: 320, thickness: 34, lead: 8, tail: 8, keep: { share: 1 } }, size);
console.log(kept.overflow); // [ 'edit' ]
```

An arrangement is stored as versioned plain data; reading it back never throws:

```ts
import { arrangement, readArrangement, storeArrangement } from "@n-uf/placement/toolbar";

const saved = JSON.stringify(storeArrangement(arrangement({ top: { start: ["file", "edit"] } }))); // { "v": 1, "hosts": … }
console.log(readArrangement(JSON.parse(saved)).ok); // true
console.log(readArrangement({ v: 9 })); // { ok: false, error: 'unknown version 9 (this reads version 1)' }
```

`readArrangement` takes parsed data, not the string. It accepts an arrangement that lacks some of your groups (one
stored before you added a group, say): place each missing group yourself, with `resetGroup(read, group, defaults)`
to put it where your default arrangement has it, or `dockGroup` for a group that floated.

## Drop targets

```ts
import { DEFAULT_OPTIONS, createDesk, liftOut } from "@n-uf/placement/dock";
import { deskDrop, deskTargets } from "@n-uf/placement/targets";

const desk = createDesk({
  panels: [{ id: 1, title: "Files", natural: 160 }, { id: 2, title: "Outline", natural: 200 }],
  start: { left: [1, 2], right: [], bottom: [] },
});
const c = desk.constructionOf("dockTear");
const key = "panel:2";
const input = { c, s0: liftOut(c.initial([1]), key), key, size: { width: 1200, height: 700 }, opt: DEFAULT_OPTIONS };
const targets = deskTargets(input); // hand these to @n-uf/motion/drag's createDragIntent
const float = targets.find((t) => t.id === "float")!;
const drop = deskDrop(input, float, { x: 600, y: 300 }, { x: 20, y: 10 });
console.log(drop.label, drop.slot.x, drop.slot.y); // Float here 580 290
```

A toolbar group's targets come from `hostTargets` (a host's lines and empty zones, with its own place left out and
returned as `own`, for the drag's home) and `floatTarget`. Each host target carries its `slot`, the group's rect
once it lands there; `allows(group, place)` leaves out places a group may not go. `keyboardStops` puts the targets
in reading order (title, top, left, right, bottom; start, centre, end) for the arrow keys and a "Move to" menu,
with the group's own place as `home`:

```ts
import { hostTargets, keyboardStops } from "@n-uf/placement/targets";
import { arrangement, hostOf, type Place } from "@n-uf/placement/toolbar";

const a = arrangement({ top: { start: ["file", "edit"], end: ["share"] } });
const size = (_id: string, _vertical: boolean, collapsed: boolean) => ({ along: collapsed ? 30 : 120, across: 28 });
const allows = (g: string, place: Place | "float") => g !== "share" || (place !== "float" && place.host === "top"); // share stays in the top bar
const top = { origin: { x: 0, y: 40 }, spec: { length: 800, thickness: 34, lead: 8, tail: 8 } };
const { targets } = hostTargets({ group: "share", arrangement: a, host: "top", ...top, size, allows });
console.log(targets[0]!.slot); // { x: 8, y: 43, width: 120, height: 28 }
const stops = keyboardStops(targets, { home: { place: hostOf(a, "share")!, arrangement: a } });
console.log(stops.map((s) => (s.home ? "home" : s.id))); // [ 'g:top:start:0', 'g:top:start:1', 'g:top:start:2', 'g:top:center:0', 'home' ]
```

## Pane zones

`paneZone(rect, point, previous, options?)` says which of a pane's five zones a point is in: the centre rectangle
(34 % of each axis, at least 24 px) or one of four edge trapezoids. The previous zone holds for 6 px past its
boundary. It fits `@n-uf/motion/drag`'s `placeOf(target, point, previous)`: one target per pane, the zone as the
place, and a null place for a zone that takes no drop.

```ts
import { paneZone, type PaneZone } from "@n-uf/placement/targets";

const pane = { x: 0, y: 0, width: 200, height: 200 };
console.log(paneZone(pane, { x: 100, y: 100 }), paneZone(pane, { x: 190, y: 100 })); // center right
console.log(paneZone(pane, { x: 137, y: 100 }, "center")); // center: 3 px past the line, it holds

// As a placeOf: the pane's id and zone, none where this pane can't take a drop beside it.
const canSplit = false;
const placeOf = (t: { id: string; hit: typeof pane }, p: { x: number; y: number }, previous: string | null): string | null => {
  const zone = paneZone(t.hit, p, (previous?.split(":")[1] as PaneZone | undefined) ?? null);
  return zone === "center" || canSplit ? `${t.id}:${zone}` : null;
};
console.log(placeOf({ id: "a", hit: pane }, { x: 100, y: 100 }, null), placeOf({ id: "a", hit: pane }, { x: 10, y: 100 }, null)); // a:center null
```
