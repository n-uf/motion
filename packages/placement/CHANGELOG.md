# @n-uf/placement

Versions are calendar versions, `YY.M.R` (year, month of the release, counter within the month), shared with
`@n-uf/motion`: both packages carry the same version, and a release bumps both.

## 26.11.6

- `@n-uf/placement/targets`:
  - `keyboardStops(targets, { home?, floats? })`: a group's places in one list in reading order (hosts title, top,
    left, right, bottom; zones start, centre, end; each insertion point in order), with its own place as a `home`
    stop when given and floating last only when asked. Each stop has the target id, a label, its place and the
    arrangement a move there makes: one list for the arrow keys and a "Move to" menu, no parsing of target ids.
  - Host targets carry their `slot`: the group's rect in the host once it lands there. `hostAfter(arrangement)`
    says where the host is then, when it grows or appears; default: as it is now.
  - `allows(group, place | "float")` in `hostTargets`' input: a place it refuses is no target. Its `place.index`
    counts the groups there without the dragged one (as `insertGroup` does). For floating, the same rule decides
    whether you add `floatTarget` at all: `...(allows(g, "float") ? [floatTarget(input)] : [])`.
- `@n-uf/placement/toolbar`:
  - `HostSpec.keep`: a per-group keep priority (default 0). When room runs out, a lower keep collapses first;
    among equal keeps the trailing end still goes first, so a primary group at the end can stay open. `HostSpec`
    takes the group id type.
  - `storeArrangement(arrangement)` / `readArrangement(data, groups?)`: a versioned stored form (`{ v: 1, hosts,
    collapsed, floating }`). Reading parsed data gives `{ ok: true, arrangement }` or `{ ok: false, error }`, never a
    throw: an unknown version, a missing host or zone, a value of the wrong kind, a group in two places, an unknown
    group. An arrangement lacking some known groups reads fine; place those with `resetGroup` or `dockGroup`.
- New exports: the types `FloatTargetInput`, `Allows`, `KeyboardStop`, `KeyboardStopsOptions` and the constant
  `HOST_READING_ORDER`. `ToolbarTarget.slot` is a required field, so hand-built targets (fixtures, mocks) add it.

## 26.11.5

- `@n-uf/placement/targets`: `paneZone(rect, point, previous, options?)`, a pane's five drop zones: the centre
  rectangle (34 % of each axis, at least 24 px, its edges snapped to the device-pixel grid) or one of four edge
  trapezoids from the corners. The previous zone holds for 6 px past its boundary. `paneCentre` gives the centre's
  rectangle (to draw the zones); `PANE_ZONE_DEFAULTS` and `PANE_EDGES` (the tie-break order) come with it. It fits
  `@n-uf/motion/drag`'s new `placeOf(target, point, previous)`: the zone is the place, and a zone that takes no drop
  answers null. Ported from hypr-tiling's engine.
- Fix: `sameArrangement` compares the collapsed groups and the floating groups' ids both ways, so a repeated group on
  one side no longer passes for a different group on the other.
- The README lists all fifteen layout note codes; every code has a test.

## 26.11.4

The first release: where things go, as pure functions over plain data. No DOM, no framework, no motion, no
dependencies.

- `@n-uf/placement`: `Rect`, `Size`, `Point`, `rect`, `overlap`, `clampInto`, `centre`, and `positionPopup` (anchor,
  gravity, offset, then flip, slide, resize per axis) with the `BELOW_LEFT` rule.
- `@n-uf/placement/dock`: `createDesk({ panels, docTitle?, start, opened? })` gives the nine desk constructions as
  presets (edge docks with the bottom dock between or full width, one tiling tree, navigator + inspector, a
  scrolling strip, drawers, palettes over or around the documents, edge docks + tear-off). Each is a pure layout:
  state, stage size and options in, a placed rect per item and notes on how it gave way out. A note's `code`
  (`bottom-folded`, `dock-folded`, `sections-folded`, `tiles-float`, …, with `side` and `items` where they apply)
  is the contract; its `text` may change. Also exported: `DEFAULT_OPTIONS`, `LAYER`, the gap `G`, the item keys
  (`panelKey`, `docKey`, `idOf`, …), `draggable`, `stripGeometry`, and the state changes `withDocs`, `touch`,
  `toggleFold`, `toggleClosed`, `withActive`, `liftOut`. Panel and document ids are numbers; item keys are strings.
- `@n-uf/placement/toolbar`: arrangements of groups in five hosts and three zones, or floating (`insertGroup`,
  `withoutGroup`, `floatGroup`, `dockGroup`, `resetGroup`, `moveToHost`, `moveBar`, `toggleCollapsed`);
  `layoutHost` (zones along the host, the centre centred, trailing-first collapse to handle and », an optional
  centre minimum counted in the need); `insertions` (before all, between, after all, empty zones); `isOwnPlace`
  and `sameArrangement` (field by field, whatever order the zones were written in). Group ids are the consumer's
  strings.
- `@n-uf/placement/targets`: drop targets in the shape `@n-uf/motion/drag` takes. `deskTargets` and `deskDrop` for
  every construction (rails, dock slots, tree slots, strip columns, tab strips, corner stacks, free placement with
  edge snapping); `hostTargets` and `floatTarget` for toolbar groups (own place left out, returned as `own`).
