# @n-uf/motion

Versions are calendar versions, `YY.M.R` (year, month of the release, counter
within the month), the same scheme as `@n-uf/hypr-tiling`.

## 26.11.0

First version: the motion package of the surface's layout-and-motion concept.

- **clock/**: `createFrameLoop` runs one-shot and repeating tasks in four
  phases (input, update, layout, write), requests frames only while it has
  work, defers deferrable tasks past a frame budget, and keeps stats.
  `ClockPort` has the shape of hypr-tiling's `SchedulerPort`;
  `createFakeClock` drives everything by hand in tests.
- **signals/**: `signal`, `computed`, `effect`, `batch`, `untracked` on
  alien-signals' core; effects take a `schedule`, and `loop.scheduler(phase)`
  runs them once per frame.
- **values/**: springs (exact closed-form steps, critically damped by
  default, velocity kept across retargets) and tweens with easing functions,
  over numbers, points, rects and vectors; `motionValue` / `springValue` /
  `tweenValue` step them on a loop as signals, with settle events and a
  reduced-motion switch.
- **gestures/**: the pdfized surface's input recogniser, made public:
  `createRecognizer` (click or drag per device, double and triple click, long
  press, pinch and two-finger pan, Safari's trackpad pinch, recovery from
  lost releases), wheel normalisation and modifiers, with its long-press
  timer on a `ClockPort`. Beside it `createFrameCoalescer`, the dwell
  (spring-load) reducer, and `createMachine` to run a reducer with its
  timers on a clock.
- `@n-uf/motion/browser`: `createBrowserClock` and `prefersReducedMotion`.
- One package with entries for the whole core and for each folder
  (`/clock`, `/signals`, `/values`, `/gestures`), plus `/browser`.
